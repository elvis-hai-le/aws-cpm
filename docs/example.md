We want to create documentation which explains and makes understanding the parts of the application easy for everyone.

## Inital Setup
Should be its own document but..
1. Install Node.js https://nodejs.org/en
2. Navigate to the project folder in your shell
3. Use the node package manager to install all of the project dependencies.
    - `npm install`

## Running the front end
Code will use the vue cli to run the front end in a development environment
### Set up
```
npm install
```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

## Running the back end

## Starting the Database

## Running the full project together (development mode)

## Deploying the project for production
